## Introduction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals using machine learning techniques on a dataset derived from the 2020 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. The main goal is to enhance early detection and prevention strategies for heart disease, potentially saving lives by identifying high-risk individuals.

## Problem Definition
Many individuals are unaware of undiagnosed heart conditions, which can lead to preventable deaths if not detected early. The objective is to develop a model that can predict the presence of heart disease based on specific health-related variables.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from the 2020 BRFSS survey, which includes data from over 400,000 records, processed to focus on variables significantly impacting heart disease risk. This project uses the 2020 dataset curated and published on Kaggle.

## Project Goals
The main goal is to accurately identify patterns within the dataset that correlate with heart disease presence using deep learning techniques. This falls under the category of binary classification, where the "HeartDisease" column indicates whether a respondent has had heart disease ("Yes" or "No").
